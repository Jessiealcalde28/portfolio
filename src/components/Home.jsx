      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
      Hi there! I'm Jessie A. Alcalde, a BSIT student with a passion for technology and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
      My interest in the digital world started with a fascination for how websites and apps come to life, which eventually led me to explore the world of software development. Today, I'm driven by the goal of creating practical, real-world solutions using code and continuously learning more about web development and IT systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio is a collection of some of the projects I’ve worked on so far. I'm excited to keep learning,
        building, and sharing my progress along the way.
